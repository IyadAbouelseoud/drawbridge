# DRAWBRIDGE — 14-Week Roadmap

> Persistent context. Read with `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `COMPLIANCE-GCC.md` at the start
> of any session.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| Current week | 2 |
| Scope | **Dual-jurisdiction: US (CBP) + GCC/KSA (ZATCA)** as of week 2 |
| Current milestone | `mcp-docs` + bilingual extraction service |
| Week 1 exit gate | **PASSED** — 10/10 containers healthy, MCP handshakes verified |

---

## Milestones

| Wk | Milestone | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scaffold, compose stack, CI, schemas package | `docker compose up` — all services green |
| 2–3 | `mcp-docs` + bilingual extraction service | 7501 **and ZATCA Bayan** to typed lines, >=95% field accuracy with provenance spans; Arabic/English |
| 3–4 | `mcp-hts`: USITC schedule ingest, CROSS corpus + pgvector | Classification query returns cited rulings |
| 4–6 | **Matcher** — `MatchStrategy`: US CP-SAT substitution + GCC declaration linkage | Golden fixture set per jurisdiction: known-answer claims reproduce to the cent |
| 6–7 | `mcp-claims` + per-jurisdiction rules: windows, thresholds, lane routing | Refund quantification with full derivation trail; GCC USD 5k gate and 6-month clock enforced |
| 7–8 | Agent layer: exception handling, interchangeability narratives | Analyst in Claude Code can close an exception via MCP tools |
| 8–9 | n8n orchestration + HITL approval gates | End-to-end run with no manual intervention outside gates |
| 9–10 | `packager`: 7551/7552/PSC/1520(d) + ZATCA refund request payload | Packet accepted by a licensed broker in each jurisdiction |
| 10–11 | `mcp-ledger` + §163 recordkeeping posture | Any figure traceable to source span, four years later |
| 11–12 | Multi-tenant hardening: RLS, Authentik, secrets, OTel | Second tenant onboarded with zero code change |
| 12–13 | Pilot: one US importer + one KSA re-exporter, backward-looking claims | Filed claim in each jurisdiction, refund in motion |
| 14 | Broker white-label packaging + on-prem compose | Reproducible `.onprem.yml` deploy |

## Week 1 task breakdown

- [x] Anonymity lock: `.claude/settings.json` (repo + global), `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Persistent docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- [x] Toolchain: `uv`, `pre-commit`, `make`, `psql`
- [x] `git init`, GitHub repo created and pushed
- [x] Repository scaffold: `services/`, `mcp_servers/`, `packages/`, `n8n/`, `tests/`, `infra/`
- [x] `packages/schemas` — shared Pydantic contracts
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — Postgres/pgvector, Redis, MinIO, n8n, API, MCP placeholders
- [x] CI: ruff + mypy + pytest on push
- [x] `docker compose up` verified green — Week 1 exit gate PASSED

## Week 2 task breakdown

- [x] GCC/ZATCA compliance research — primary source captured in `COMPLIANCE-GCC.md`
- [x] Dual-jurisdiction architecture: `MatchStrategy`, jurisdiction profiles
- [x] Per-service multi-stage Dockerfiles (api + 5 MCP servers)
- [x] Alembic baseline: claim state machine, both jurisdictions
- [x] `mcp-docs`: MinIO-backed store, span-addressable retrieval
- [x] Extraction: native PDF path + bilingual ar/en OCR fallback
- [x] Golden fixtures: hand-verified CBP 7501 and ZATCA Bayan answer keys

## Week 3 entry checklist

1. Real OCR execution path — week 2 ships the native path plus the bilingual
   normalisation layer; Tesseract `ara+eng` invocation is wired but needs a scanned
   corpus to tune the confidence floor against.
2. `mcp-hts`: USITC schedule ingest and CROSS corpus into pgvector. GCC tariff schedule is
   HS-based and needs its own loader.
3. Bilingual field alias table populated from real *Bayan* layouts (currently seeded with
   the common labels only).
4. Confirm ZATCA Resolution 28624 article numbers against the Arabic Umm Al-Qura text —
   see `COMPLIANCE-GCC.md` §7 open questions.

## Sequencing rationale

Extraction (wk 2–3) precedes matching (wk 4–6) because the matcher's input contract is
defined by what extraction can actually guarantee — building the matcher first would fix
a contract against imagined data.

The GCC lane entered at week 2 rather than later because it changes the *shape* of the
matcher, not just its constants (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.5). Discovering that substitution
does not exist in GCC law after building a substitution-shaped matcher would have meant
rewriting weeks 4–6, not extending them.

The agent layer (wk 7–8) lands *after* the deterministic core, so the LLM is scoped to
exactly the residue the rules engine cannot decide. Building it earlier invites the model
to absorb work that belongs in testable code.

The pilot (wk 12–13) targets a backward-looking claim rather than live flow: a 5-year
lookback has a known answer set and no operational dependency on the customer's current
quarter.
