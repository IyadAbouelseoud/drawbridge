# DRAWBRIDGE — 14-Week Roadmap

> Persistent context. Read with `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `COMPLIANCE-GCC.md` at the start
> of any session.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| Current week | 5 |
| Scope | **Dual-jurisdiction: US (CBP) + GCC/KSA (ZATCA)** as of week 2 |
| Current milestone | Analyst MCP tools, HTS engine, queue resolution |
| Week 1 exit gate | **PASSED** — 10/10 containers healthy, MCP handshakes verified |

---

## Milestones

| Wk | Milestone | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scaffold, compose stack, CI, schemas package | `docker compose up` — all services green |
| 2–3 | `mcp-docs` + bilingual extraction service | 7501 **and ZATCA Bayan** to typed lines, >=95% field accuracy with provenance spans; Arabic/English |
| 3–4 | `mcp-hts`: USITC schedule ingest, CROSS corpus + pgvector | Classification query returns cited rulings |
| 3–6 | **Matcher** — `MatchStrategy`: US CP-SAT substitution + GCC declaration linkage | Golden fixture set per jurisdiction: known-answer claims reproduce to the cent |
| 6–7 | `mcp-claims` + per-jurisdiction rules: windows, thresholds, lane routing | Refund quantification with full derivation trail; GCC USD 5k gate and 6-month clock enforced |
| 7–8 | Agent layer: exception handling, interchangeability narratives | Analyst in Claude Code can close an exception via MCP tools |
| 8–9 | n8n orchestration + HITL approval gates | End-to-end run with no manual intervention outside gates |
| 9–10 | `packager`: 7551/7552/PSC/1520(d) + ZATCA refund request payload | Packet accepted by a licensed broker in each jurisdiction |
| 10–11 | `mcp-ledger` + §163 recordkeeping posture | Any figure traceable to source span, four years later |
| 11–12 | Multi-tenant hardening: RLS, Authentik, secrets, OTel | Second tenant onboarded with zero code change |
| 12–13 | Pilot: one US importer + one KSA re-exporter, backward-looking claims | Filed claim in each jurisdiction, refund in motion |
| 14 | Broker white-label packaging + on-prem compose | Reproducible `.onprem.yml` deploy |

## Week 1 task breakdown

- [x] Anonymity lock: `.claude/settings.json` (repo + global), `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Persistent docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- [x] Toolchain: `uv`, `pre-commit`, `make`, `psql`
- [x] `git init`, GitHub repo created and pushed
- [x] Repository scaffold: `services/`, `mcp_servers/`, `packages/`, `n8n/`, `tests/`, `infra/`
- [x] `packages/schemas` — shared Pydantic contracts
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` — Postgres/pgvector, Redis, MinIO, n8n, API, MCP placeholders
- [x] CI: ruff + mypy + pytest on push
- [x] `docker compose up` verified green — Week 1 exit gate PASSED

## Week 2 task breakdown

- [x] GCC/ZATCA compliance research — primary source captured in `COMPLIANCE-GCC.md`
- [x] Dual-jurisdiction architecture: `MatchStrategy`, jurisdiction profiles
- [x] Per-service multi-stage Dockerfiles (api + 5 MCP servers)
- [x] Alembic baseline: claim state machine, both jurisdictions
- [x] `mcp-docs`: MinIO-backed store, span-addressable retrieval
- [x] Extraction: native PDF path + bilingual ar/en OCR fallback
- [x] Golden fixtures: hand-verified CBP 7501 and ZATCA Bayan answer keys

## Week 3 task breakdown

- [x] Path A: US substitution allocation via OR-Tools CP-SAT (`us_substitution.py`)
- [x] Path B: GCC direct-identification linkage with statutory gates (`gcc_linkage.py`)
- [x] `MatchStrategy` interface and jurisdiction-driven routing in the API
- [x] Property-based tests: CP-SAT optimality, GCC day-185 rejection

### Explicitly deferred — glyph x-coordinate RTL table parsing

Robust RTL **table** parsing needs glyph x-coordinates: deciding whether an Arabic run is
stored in visual or logical order is undecidable from the character stream (week 2
`arabic.looks_visually_ordered` uses a label heuristic that works for `label: value` lines
and cannot work for table cells, which carry no separator).

That work is **isolated to `services/extraction/src/geometry.py`** and stubbed, so it does
not block the matching engine. The matcher consumes `EntryLine` / `ExportLine`, which are
already typed and already populated by the week 2 native path — nothing in weeks 3-6
depends on table extraction landing. Revisit once a real scanned *Bayan* corpus exists.

## Week 4 task breakdown

- [x] ZATCA valuation basis resolved — FX anchors to the duty-payment date
      (Valuation Art. 1(I)(6)); hardcoded 3.75 peg removed from `gcc_linkage.py`
- [x] `services/rules/src/fx.py` — dated `RateProvider`, rates held as exact ratios
- [x] Art. 16 §2 threshold enforced strictly; near misses rejected and flagged
- [x] Manufacturing drawback §1313(a)/(b): BOM explosion in the CP-SAT model
- [x] `review_queue` table + `services/rules/src/triage.py` HITL gate
- [x] Three declarative n8n workflows generated from `n8n/generate_workflows.py`

## Week 5 task breakdown

- [x] GCC open questions closed against primary source (`COMPLIANCE-GCC.md` §8)
- [x] `mcp-claims`: analyst tools over the review queue and claim state machine
- [x] `mcp-ledger`: append-only audit trail of analyst decisions
- [x] `mcp-hts`: pgvector classification search over USITC/CROSS and ZATCA tariff
- [x] Queue resolution notifies n8n to resume the suspended workflow
- [x] Integration tests: exception -> MCP resolve -> claim reaches `approved`

## Week 6 entry checklist

1. **Live Fasah sandbox test** for partial-consignment linkage — `COMPLIANCE-GCC.md`
   §8.2. Permitted in law (Art. 16 §4, Art. 44(b)); platform behaviour undocumented.
2. Obtain the Arabic text of ZATCA Resolution 28624 and map its article numbers into
   `services/packager/` citations — §8.4. Every public route 404s or 500s; needs a direct
   request to ZATCA or the Umm Al-Qura print archive.
3. Real tariff corpora: USITC schedule + CROSS rulings, ZATCA Integrated Customs Tariff.
   Week 5 ships the ingest and search path against a seeded corpus.
4. Real OCR execution path against a scanned *Bayan* corpus, to tune the confidence floor.
5. Multi-level BOM nesting (currently flattened at ingest), pending ERP integration.
6. `services/packager`: CBP 7551/7552 and the ZATCA refund-request payload.

## Sequencing rationale

Extraction (wk 2–3) precedes matching (wk 4–6) because the matcher's input contract is
defined by what extraction can actually guarantee — building the matcher first would fix
a contract against imagined data.

The GCC lane entered at week 2 rather than later because it changes the *shape* of the
matcher, not just its constants (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.5). Discovering that substitution
does not exist in GCC law after building a substitution-shaped matcher would have meant
rewriting weeks 4–6, not extending them.

The agent layer (wk 7–8) lands *after* the deterministic core, so the LLM is scoped to
exactly the residue the rules engine cannot decide. Building it earlier invites the model
to absorb work that belongs in testable code.

The pilot (wk 12–13) targets a backward-looking claim rather than live flow: a 5-year
lookback has a known answer set and no operational dependency on the customer's current
quarter.
